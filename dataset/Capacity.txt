Capacity dataset comprises 15-minute interval measurements of peak CPU and memory usage collected from the servers of a financial enterprise over a three-month period, from August 2024 to October 2024. Each data point now includes four values: a timestamp (date), a device/application type (an integer from 0 to 134), the peak CPU usage percentage, and the peak memory usage percentage. These values together reflect the computational load on various devices within the servers during this time frame.
